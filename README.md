Analyzed the Car Dekho dataset (~8,126 used cars) from Kaggle to uncover trends in car availability, fuel types, and sales.

## Tools
- **SQL** and **MySQL**: Data extraction and aggregation.
- **Power BI** (in progress): Planned interactive dashboards.

## Analysis

  - Price Trends: Average selling price (2015–2023).
- Placeholder PDF: Describes planned visuals (see `docs/car_dekho_dashboards.pdf`).

## Files
